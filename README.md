# hex002-womb

»WOMB« is lucid underwater music composed by Kajsa Lindgren and released 15/06/18 on [Hyperdelia](https://hyperdelia.com). This is a virtual experience of »WOMB«, put your headphones on and take a dip.

»WOMB« is a musical narration for abstracted ears and bodies – engulfing a listener simultaneously in subaquatic sonic environments, distant dreams of childhoods, memories and voices from the unknown: where time and space fold into each other.
